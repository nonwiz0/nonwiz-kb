# Cell Division
## Term
- zygote is an fertilized egg (embryo).
- genome is a double-stranded DNA molecule in the form of a loop or circle (DNA of all cells packaged).
- nucleoid is a region in the cell containing the genetic material of genome.
- plasmids are the smaller loops of DNA that are not essential for normal growth (prokaryote).
- Somatic cell contains two matched or homologous sets of chromosomes ( one from each biological parent) **diploid** (2n)
- Gamete cell contains one set of chromosomes **haploid** (n)
- Homologous ("same knowledge") chromosome: a diploid cell containing a matched pairs of chromosomes.
- Genes: functional unit of chromosome, nucleotide segments, determine specific characteristics by coding for specific proteins. 
	- Traits are variations of those characteristics like hair color (black, blonde, brown, white)
- Karyotype: the arrangement where condensed chromosomes are viewed within the nucleus (top), removed from a cell during mitosis and spread out on a slide (right) and artificially arranged according to length (left).
- alleles (different genes) are not identical code for the same traits but has different value. 
- chromatin: DNA-histone complex
- linker DNA, DNA connecting the nucleosome
- cell cycle: is an ordered series of events involving cell growth and cell division that produce two new daughter cells. Cells on the path to cell divsion proceed through a series of precisely timed and carefully regulated stages of growth, DNA replication, nuclear, and cytoplasmic divsion that ultimately produces two identical (clone) cells. Two major phases are interphase and mitotic phase.
- Interphase: first major phase of cell cycle, the cell grow and DNA is replicated.
- Mitotic phase (karyokinesis): the second major phase of cell cycle, where the replicated DNA and cytoplasmic contents are separated.
- Cytokinesis, third process of cell cycle.
- Mitotic spindle, the apparatus that orchestrates the movement of chromosomes during mitosis.
- Cytokinesis - the physical separation of cytoplasmic components into the two daughter cells.
- Apoptosis: the suicide of cell.
- cancer: uncontrolled cell growth, improper replication of DNA during the S phase. 
- proto-oncogenes: positive cell-cycle regulators., normal genes when mutated in certain ways become oncogenes - genes that cause a cell to become cancerous.
- Hypoxia: a condition of reduced oxygen supply.
- Binary Fission: a simple prokaryotic cell division.

## Cell Division
- All multicellular organisms use cell division for **growth**, **maintenance**, **repair of cells and tissues**
- Use of plasmids: exchange with other bacteria might receive new genes that can add to chromosomal DNA and Antibiotic resistance.
- Each species has a specific number of chromosomes:
- Human DNA is measured appropximately 2 meters; its diameter is **2 nm** compare to the size of typical human cell is **10 Î¼m**
- The variation of individuals within a species is due to the specific combination of the genes inherited from both parents, slight altered sequence of nucleotides within a gene can result in an alternative trait. It is also possible to have two copies of the same gene sequence on both homologous chrmosomes with one on each (for example, AA, BB, or OO) or two different sequences such as AB, AO, BO
- DNA replicates in the S phase of interphase, before mitosis occur, after the replication, chromosomes are ocmpsoed of two linked sister chromatids. When fully compact, the pairs of identically packed chromosomes are bound to each other by cohesin proteins. The connection between the sister chromatids is clsoest in a region called centromere. 

Number of somatic cells:
- Human somatic cells have 46 chromosomes, 
- Human gamates (sperm or egg) have 23 chromosomes
- pea plant have 14 chromosomes
- sun flower - 34 chromosomes
- cat - 38 chromosome
- Puffer fish - 42 chromosomes
- dog - 78 chromosomes

### Prokaryote vs Eukaryote

Genome | Single, double-stranded DNA | Several, double-stranded linear DNA molecules

### Eukaryotic Chromosomal Structure and Compaction
There are number of ways that chromosomes are compacted as the long strands of DNA are condensed into compact chromosomes during certain stages of the cell cycle, this so that it can be tightly packaged to fit in the cell nucleus. Below here is the level of compaction and organization of Eukaryotic chromosomes:
1. A short stretches of DNA double helix wrap around a core of 8 histone proteins at regular intervals along the entire length of the chromosome. The bead which is nucleosome are about 10 nm in diameter. 
2. Nucleosomes and linker DNA between them coil into a 30 nm chromatin fiber. *Coiling* further condenses the chromosome so that it is now about 50 times shorter than the extended form.
3. Variety of fibrous proteins is used to pack the chromatin. The fibrous protein also ensure that each chromosome in a non-dividing cell occupies a particular area of the nucleus that does not overlap with any other chromosome.
4. Chromosomes are composed of two linked sister chromatids, the pairs of identically packed chromosomes are bound to each other by cohesion proteins, sister chromatids is closest in a region called centremere. It has the diameter of 1 um.

## Cell Cycle

### Interphase
Cell undergoes normal growth processes while also preparing for cell division. In order for a cell to move from interphase into the mitotic phase, many internal and external conditions must met. The three main phases: G_1, S, G_2.
1. G_1 Phase (First Gap)
The cell is quite active at biochemical l evel. The cell is accumulating the building blocks of chromosomal DNA and the associated proteins as well as accumulating sufficient energy reservese to complete the task of replicating each chromosome in the nucleus.
2. S Phase (Synthesis of DNA)
DNA replication can proceed through the mechanism that result in the formation of identical pairs of DNA, sister chromatids, that are firmly attached to the centromeric region. The centrosome is also duplicated during S phase, two centrosomes of homologous chromosomes give rise to the mitotic spindle.
3. G_2 Phase (Second Gap)
Cell replenishes its energy stores and synthesizes proteins necessary for chromosome manipulation and movement. Some cell organelles are duplicated and the cytoskeleton is pull apart to provide resources for the mitotic phase. There may be additional cell growth during G2. This is also the final preparation before cell enter mitosis.

### Mitotic phase
![[mitosis_five_stages.png]]
A multistep process during which the duplicated chromosomes are aligned, separated, and move into two new, identical daughter cells.

## Control of Cell Cycle
In rapidly dividing human cells within 24 hours, G_1 takes about 9 hours, S takes about 10 hours, and G_2 takes about 4.5 hours. And M phase lasts approximately 1.5 hour

#### Regulation of the cell cycle by external events
Both initiation and inhibition of cell division are triggered by events external to the cell when it is:
- Death of nearby cells release of growth promoting hormones, such as human growth hormone (HGH or hGH)
	- A lack of HGH can inhibit division, resulting in dwarfism
	- Too much HGH can result in gigantism
- Crowding of cells can also inhibit cell division.
- Size of the cell, can initiate cell divsion, cell grows bigger, it decreases the surface to volume ratio. The solution to this problem is to divide.

#### Regulation by Internal checkpoints
There are three main checkpoints:
- G_1 checkpoint is to check the integrity of DNA by considering several factors (growth factor presence, cell size, genome damage)
- G_2 checkpoint assess the proper chromosome duplication. Here is to check whether chromosomes have been replicated, replicated DNAs are not damaged, if not complete the DNA replication or repair the damaged DNA.
- M checkpoint assess the attachment of each kinetochore to a spindle fiber. Check whether all sister chromatids are ready for being pull apart.

#### Regulator molecules 
There are two groups of intracellular molecules:
	- Promote progress of the cell to the next phase (positive regulation): active molecules cause the cell cycle to progress.
	- Stop the cycle (negative regulation). Active molecules cause the cell cycle to stop.

Positive regulation uses two groups of positive regulatory proteins, they are responsible for the progress of the cell through the variosu checkpoints
1. Cyclins: regulate the cell cycle only when they are tightly bound to Cdks. Largely based on the timing of the cell cycle. Main regulatory molecules that determine the forward momentum of the cell cycle.
2. Cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks): enzymes (kinases) that are in turn phosphorylate other than proteins. Regulation usually occurs by either the Cdk molecules alone or by Cdk/cyclin complexes. Cdk proteins are stable but the concentration of cyclin fluncate and is hte one to determine when Cdk/cyclin complxes form. Cdok inhibitors prevent the full activation of Cdks until the prblem of the cell cycle solved.

Negative regulation have:
- p53, Retinoblastoma protein (Rb), and p21 (the numbers 53 and 21) represent the masses of the proteins in Kdaltons. **Rb, p53, p21** act primarily at the G_1 checkpoint.
- p53, multi-functional protein that has major impact on the commitment of the cell to division If DNA is damaged, p53 stops the cell cycle and recruits specific enzyme to repair the DNA.
- p21, triggered when p53 levels increase, this enforces the stop in cycle dictated by p53, binding to Cdk/cyclin complex and inhibit this complex, cell is exposed to more stress with higher levels of p53 and p21 accumulated, cell can't move to S phase
- Rb monitor cell size

## Cancer and the cell cycle
- Cancer comprises many different diseased caused by a common mechanism: uncontrolled cell growth.
- The problem occurs as the improper replication of DNA during the S phase.
- When cell-cycle controls are fully functional, a small percentage of replication errorsr (mutations) will passed to the daughter cells -> a gene mutation result.
- cancers start whe na gene mutation gives rise to a faulty protein that plays a key role in cell reproduction.
- gene mutation causes a change that increases the activit yof a positive regulator in which mean Cdk gene can be activated without being partnered with cyclin - push the cell cycle past a checkpoint before all requirements are met.

### Tumor suppressor genes 
- Tumor suppressor genes are segments of DNA that code for negative regulator proteins, the type of regulators that when activated, can prevent the cell from undergoing uncontrolled division.
- Rb, p53, and p21: to put up a roadblock to cell-cycle progression until certain events are completed.
- Mutated p53 or damaged will not do G_1 checkpoint appropriately in which just let the cell continue. In which its usual role is to monitor DNA and the supply of oxygen.

## Prokaryotic cell divsion
- Binary fission is a simple prokaryotic cell divsion, DNA is only duplicated adn separated in to daughter cell.
