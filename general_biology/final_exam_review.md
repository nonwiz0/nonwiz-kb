## Examination Inclusion
#### Section 1 - Matching (20 points):
- Chapter 10, 11, 12 - about 3 to 4 questions
- Chapter 14 - 2 questions
- Chapter 19 - 2 questions
- Chapter 17 - 6 questions
Prepare the terminology and definition (mostly) from these chapter:
- What is karyotype?
- What is gene flow?

##### Term
- Karyotype: the arrangement where the condensed chromosomes are viewed within the nucleus (top), removed from a cell during mitosis and spread out on a slide (right) and artificialy arranged according to the length (left).

#### Section 2 - Short answer 
Give complete statement, do not answer with only one word or two words, we have to give complete sentence [Subject, verb, object] except the listing for the process. If asked what it means by or how is this happening, we have to explain 2 to 4 sentences.
-  Chapter 10, 11 [Quite a lot]: Understanding about mitosis and meiosis, (15 marks x 2 = 30 marks). 
- Chapter 12 (4 marks)
- Chapter 13 (5 marks)
- Chapter 14 (7 marks)
- Chapter 15 (13 marks)
- Chapter 16 (10 marks)
- Chapter 17 (5 marks)
- Chapter 19 (6 marks)
It's general question about the key knowledge of each chapters, for example in mitosis, what is mean by cell reproduction. We have to explain about that. The key knowledge of each topic you need to know. 
- What is mean by cell reproduction....
- How is this different from that? (Diploid and haploid)
- Given picture, identify what is that
- The source of genetic variation
- X-link disease and the source, possibility to come up with X-link disease (small marks)
- Chromosome number disorders, quite a few different. Chromosome number disorder it cause disease and that disease if the chromosome or chromosome 21, which become trisomy. 
- If Meiosis doesn't turn out complete, then the gamete cell become less than 1 or more than 1, how do you call that disease or condition?
- Structure of DNA and RNA, the different, and similarity
- DNA replication, we need to know what happening at the replication form, and the key enzyme that is involved.
- Experiment of Mendelson and Sal talk about DNA replication.
- Central dogma of DNA that we have learned, how DNA express into RNA and then into protein.
- What's happening when DNA is transcribed into RNA?
- When RNA going to protein, what happened to that RNA?
- Gene regulation, there are one level in prokaryote cell, 5 level in eukaryote, we need to be able to identify the levels, whether they are epigenetic (before transcription), at transcription, post transcription, translation, post translation. Base on the tell scenario, we need able to tell what gene regulate in that (Chapter 16)
- Ch17: use of bacteria, use to infect the cell and its plasmic, why scientist use bad bacteria infect the plant that cause plants to have disease to become a tool for scientist to bioengineer the plant to make it in the better cultivate to resist to the disease or the pesticite. There are two bacteria that mentioned in the class: abalstilas, a growth bacteria.... (Short answers question)
- For technique of sourthern, northern, techniques, what are those techniques, using those techniques to track the gene or the protein, how do you call that technique?
- Chapter 19: evolution, the source that cause evolution in the evoluionalist understanding. 

#### Section 3 
Long answers or long thinking, critical thinking, or long essay that take longer time for per question, we got to know the process in mitosis and meiosis (to be able to tell the story, to tell how the steps in meiosis occur, what does this occur, how does it look like?)
- Chapter 10:
- Chapter 12: Mendellion Genetic - What's the gamate, what is the allele. If given genotype, you got to identify the gamete, the allele. To know about the cross monohybrid, dihybrid cross, what's the more cross like 4 allele. 4 different traits that are controlled by 8 alleles. How are we going to predict the offpsring? (Check the powerpoint of chapter 12, example of question and problem)
- Chapter 15: DNA to Protein: if given sequence of DNA that teacher make up, if she gives codon on mRNA, code and amino acid, we need to able to transcribe and translate it into mRNA and into protein.
- Chapter 16: Gene Regulation in Prokaryote: the principle of gene regulation. lac operon and trp operon, how do cell control through inducible and repressible process using lac operon and trp operon as example. 
- Chapter 17: Molecular cloning: check in the classroom, and picture that need to understand it. How do we do the molecular cloning to explain how do we make it.
- Chapter 19: calculation about allele frequency, Hardy-weinberg. Genotype frequency, predict genotype frequency of the offspring.
