# term
- asexual reproduction: organisms that can produce genetically identical clones of themselves.
- sexual reproduction: multicellular organisms reproduce regularly that involve the production by parents of two haploid cells and fusion of two haploid cells to form a single, genetically recombined diploid cell - a genetically unique organism.
- Meiosis is a type of cell division that are responsible for the sexual reproductive cycle. 
- gametes: specialized cells which contains one set of chromosome.
- Zygote: when gametes united, fertilized egg that contains two set of chromosome.
- Somatic cell: all cells of a multicellular organism except the gametes or reproductive cells.
- homologous chromosome: two copies of each chromosome that stay within nucleus. They are matched pairs containing the same genes in identical locations along their lengths.
- synapsis: the genes on chromatids of the homologous chromosomes are aligned precisely with each other.
- crossing over: a process where  the exchange of chromosomal segments between homologous nonsister chromatids take place.
- histone is the molecule that maintain the first level of DNA organization in eukaryotic cell.
- Chiasma: the site of crossing over

## The Process of meiosis
![[meiosis_mitosis.png]]
- mitosis: produces daughter cells whose nuclei are genetically identical to the original parent nucleus. Both parent and daughter nuclei are at the same "plodiy level" - diploid in the case of most multicellular most animals. Plants use mitosis to grow as sporophytes and to grow and produce eggs and sperm as gametophytes, so they use mitosis for both haploid and diploid cells.
- meiosis: starting nucleus is always diploid and daughter nuclei that result are haploid.To achieve this reduction in chromosome number, meiosis consists of one round of chromosome replicatoin followed by two rounds of nuclear division. There are two round of divisions here: meiosis I and meiosis II.
	- interphase: homologous pair of chromosomes in diploid parent cell -> chromosomes replicate -> homologous pair of replicated chromosomes contains sister chromatids, diploid cell with replicated chromosomes.
	- meiosis I: first round of meiotic division, homologous chromosomes separate -> haploid cells with replicated chromosomes.
	- meiosis II: second round of meiotic division takes place, sister chromatids separate -> haploid cells with unreplicated chromosome.
- synapsis of homologous chromosomes and crossover happen on prophase I
- homologous chromosomes line up at metaphase plate happen on metaphase I
- sister chromatids line up at metaphase plate happen on metaphase II
- the crossover events are the first source of genetic variation in the nuclei produced by meiosis. 
- cells that are produced by meiosis are genetically unique because meiosis generates variation in the daughter nuclei during crossover in prophase I as well as during the random alignment of tetrads at the metaphase I.
- The difference between meiosis and mitosis:
	- mitotic divisoins are single nuclear divisions that produce genetically identical daughter nuclei (each daughter nucleus has the same number of chromosome sets as the original cell)
	- meiotic divisions include two nuclear divisions that ultimately produce four genetically different daughter nuclei that have only one chromosome set. Here in meiosis, two nuclear division processes take place during the first division of meiosis which is homologous chromosomes pair, crossover, and exchange homologous nonsoister chromatid segment.
